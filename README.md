# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

When we run Tic-Tac-Toe.py file it will show us positions as numbers to put "X" and "O" 
It will ask us to choose position of "X"
we can choose number from 1 to 9 shown in console
Then computer will play, it will check our "X" position and will put "O" accordingly
If all positions filled and no one wins then it will be draw.

## Functions

There are different functions defined in this project for checking win, predicting next "O" position, placing "X" and "O".
For playing game there is no need to understand these functions, we can directly play game in console.
